# psychphinder

A simple app made in fyne to search your favorite quotes from the TV show Psych.

**Screenshots:**

[<img width=200 alt="mobile screenshot 2" src="metadata/screenshots/2.png?raw=true">](metadata/screenshots/2.png?raw=true)

**Future features (I hope):**
- Search in a list of references made throughout the show.
- Save your favorite quotes (couldn't figure it out how to do it by myself, so I hope that with a little help I might be able to do it)
- Share a quote in social media apps or being able to copy the text shown.


**Known bugs:**
- Can't delete text with AOSP keyboard on Android (known by fyne developers).
- UI isn't loading properly on Android 11. A workaround is to open recents and go back to the app again, then change to a different item in the list to fix the UI (don't know what could be causing this).
